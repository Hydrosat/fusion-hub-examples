This repo contains notebook(s) and python code to help show how to use and access Fusion Hub data. 
FH_Hydrosat.py contains a python class which allows a user to construct an xarray dataset from a STAC search result (items), as well as download files. Please see usage in the Fusion-hub-quickstart.ipynb notebook, and use as needed.

To return a successful query from the STAC API, you must edit the `creds.json` file to contain your username and password.

Notebooks in these examples include:
* Fusion Hub Quickstart
* Order Service Example

These notebooks and additional documentation can be found at http://fusion.hydrosat.com/docs
